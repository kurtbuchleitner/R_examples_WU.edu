### About

We take a look at an excerpt of customer data of a large Austrian electricity provider, which has already been slightly simplified. Two Excel-Sheets have been combined, one that contains current customers and the other one contained customers that already changed (churned) to a different provider. 

### Implementation

First, we load a decision tree classification library `rpart` and a library to plot decision trees, i.e. `rpart.plot`

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
```

Furthermore, we load the sample data from our data repository online

```{r}
load(url("http://vault.data-r.com/data/churn.rda"))
```

Now let's take a look at the data

```{r}
head(churn)
```

We see that we have 28616 customers with 8 attributes. The attributes have been simplified and the coding scheme is as follows:

| attribute | coding |
| ---- | ----  |
| gender | 1: female, 2: male |
| tariff | 1: cheap, 2: medium, 3 standard |
| term | 1: less than 2y, 2: 2y-5y, 3: more than 5y |
| title | 0: no title, 1: any title |
| churn | 0: current customer, 1: churned |

age, consumption and zip are not encoded.

Let's check some attribute distributions:

```{r}
summary(churn)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
hist(churn$age)
hist(churn$consumption)
hist(churn$consumption[which(churn$consumption < 10000)])
barplot(table(churn$churn))
``` 

#### Creating a decision tree

Creating a (decision tree) classifier is simple, i.e. a one-liner. The dependent variable is `churn`, which is a qualitative variable, which is why we cannot use standard regression models here, but the syntax is the same:

```{r}
fit <- rpart(churn ~ term + gender + title + age + consumption + tariff,
             method="class", data=churn)
```

And check the respective decision tree:

```{r echo = FALSE}
rpart.plot(fit)
```
